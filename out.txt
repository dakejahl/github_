These changes represent the main improvements in the system.\r\n\r\n### Multicopter\r\n* Limited-jerk trajectory generator for auto mode\r\n* Smoothing of takeoff\r\n* Mixer rewrite and Airmode for all axes\r\n* Improved Acro performance (keep integrators always enabled in-air)\r\n* Spool-up time for motors after arming\r\n* Orbit flight mode\r\n* Airspeed robustness (fault detection + failover) [BETA]\r\n\r\n### VTOL\r\n* Improved support for tiltrotors\r\n* Rate controller architecture change (run fixed wing & multicopter rate controller together to have dedicated rate controller for one set of actuators)\r\n* Active weathervane based on direction of desired thrust vector\r\n* Migration guide (vtol roll direction parameter - V19_VT_ROLLDIR)\r\n\r\n### PX4/ECL - Estimators improvement\r\n* Reduced latency from receipt of IMU data to output of vehicle Pose data\r\n* Multi GPS support (GPS blending and failover)\r\n* Support for Fusion of GPS heading\r\n* Miscellaneous optical flow data use improvements\r\n* Miscellaneous VIO data use improvements\r\n* Improve stability of attitude alignment and yaw reset at large tilt angles (eg tailsitters)\r\n\r\n### PX4/GPSDrivers\r\n* Support for u-blox F9 generation (RTK)\r\n* Initial support for Septentrio\r\n\r\n### Computer Vision & Autonomy\r\n* Full bidirectional VIO uORB messaging, with linear/angular velocity and covariance propagation, besides pose data;\r\n* Fast-RTPS bridge client and IDL definitions code generation improvements for a better integration with px4_ros_com (PX4 bridge with ROS2).\r\n\r\n### PX4/Avoidance\r\n* Collision Prevention in Position Control \r\n* Obstacle Avoidance in Mission Mode\r\n* Pre-flight checks and failsafe mechanisms for Obstacle Avoidance in Mission mode\r\n\r\n### Simulation\r\n* SITL lockstep (jMAVSim + Gazebo support)\r\n* Faster or slower than real-time simulation, support to pause or step through code, enables SITL on older or slower hardware\r\n* [Simulation in Hardware](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/simulation-in-hardware.html) module\r\n* Avoidance in Gazebo\r\n* [Serial port configuration improvements](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/peripherals/serial_configuration.html)\r\n\r\n### Logging improvements\r\n* Mission log: Minimal summary log file for flight meta data\r\n\r\n### Onboard computer / middleware improvements\r\n* Improved support for ROS2\r\n* Initial support for monitoring of an onboard computer\r\n* [Bootloader update on v2 boards](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/advanced_config/bootloader_update.html)\r\n\r\n### NuttX update\r\n* NuttX upgrade from 7.22 to 7.28+\r\n* Compressed defconfig files.\r\n* Compressed ROMFS\r\n* Many bug fixes and performance improvements\r\n\r\n### Updated Supported Hardware\r\n* Analog Devices ADIS16477, ADIS16497\r\n* AK09916 compass (Here 2 GPS)\r\n* Cm8jl65 distance sensor\r\n* PMW3901 optical flow sensor\r\n* InvenSense ICM20948 compass (Here GPS)\r\n* Pixhawk 4 Mini (full support)\r\n* NXPhlite\r\n* NCP5623C RGB LED\r\n* SMBUS batteries (improved support)\r\n* Better ESC calibration for PWM ESCs\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/Firmware/releases/17528456","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/Firmware/releases/17528456/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/PX4/Firmware/releases/17528456/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/releases/tag/v1.9.0-rc2","id":17528456,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE3NTI4NDU2","tag_name":"v1.9.0-rc2","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.9.0
